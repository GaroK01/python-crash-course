# 🐍 Python Crash Course – Learning Log

This repository contains my solutions as I work through _Python Crash Course (3rd Edition)_ by Eric Matthes. I'm using this repository to track my progress, practice Python fundamentals, and build projects in my own way from the book.

## 📚 Book Structure

The book is divided into two main parts:

### Part I – Python Basics  
Covers foundational programming concepts such as:
- Variables, strings, numbers
- Lists, dictionaries, if statements
- Loops, functions, classes

Includes three major projects:
- Alien Invasion (Game)
- Data Visualization
- Django Web App
