Title: Adding Comments

Question: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and
add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write
because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and
the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence
describing what the program does.

Answer:

fav_num = 10
msg = f"My favorite number is {fav_num}."
# The `f` before the string denotes an f-string (formatted string literal), which allows embedding expressions inside {}

print(msg)

Note: I took the exercise 9 solution, and I added a comment.
