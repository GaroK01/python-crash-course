Title: Python Module of the Week

Exercise: One excellent resource for exploring the
Python standard library is a site called Python Module of the Week. Go to
http://pymotw.com/ and look at the table of contents. Find a module that
looks interesting to you and read about it, or explore the documentation of
the collections and random modules.

Answer:

That's actually a good way to learn about new methods and modules to use in your projects.

I will provide you one module that I found insteresting: zlib — GNU zlib Compression.

Keep learning! :)
