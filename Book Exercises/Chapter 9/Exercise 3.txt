and last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored
in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary
of the user’s information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints
a personalized greeting to the user.

for each user.

    self.mobile_number = mobile_number

  def describe_user(self):
    print(f"I will provide some info about {self.first_name} {self.last_name}")
    print(f"Address: {self.address} \nMobile number: {self.mobile_number}")
