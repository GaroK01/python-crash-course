Title: Dice

Exercise: The module random contains functions that generate random numbers
in a variety of ways The function randint() returns an integer in the
range you provide. The following code returns a number between 1 and 6:
from random import randint
x = randint(1, 6)
Make a class Die with one attribute called sides, which has a default
value of 6. Write a method called roll_die() that prints a random number
between 1 and the number of sides the die has. Make a 6-sided die and roll
it 10 times.
Make a 10-sided die and a 20-sided die Roll each die 10 times.

Answer:

from random import randint

class Die:
  def __init__(self, sides=6):
    self.sides = sides

  def roll_die(self):
    return randint(1, self.sides)

# 6-sided die rolled 10 times
die_6 = Die()
for _ in range(10):
    print(die_6.roll_die())

# 10-sided die rolled 10 times
die_10 = Die(10)
for _ in range(10):
  print(die_10.roll_die())

# 20-sided die rolled 10 times
die_20 = Die(20)
for _ in range(10):
  print(die_20.roll_die())
