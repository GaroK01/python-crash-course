Title: Buffet

Exercise: A buffet-style restaurant offers only five basic foods. Think of five
simple foods, and store them in a tuple.
• Use a for loop to print each food the restaurant offers.
• Try to modify one of the items, and make sure that Python rejects the
change.
• The restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with different
foods. Add a block of code that rewrites the tuple, and then use a for
loop to print each of the items on the revised menu.

Answer:

print("Original menu:")
buffet = (steak, fries, salmon, chicken, rice)
for food in buffet:
  print(food)
# buffet[0] = 'burger' This will give an error as we can't modify a tuple 

buffet = (steak, fries, beans, salad, rice)

print("Revised menu:")
for food in buffet:
  print(food)
