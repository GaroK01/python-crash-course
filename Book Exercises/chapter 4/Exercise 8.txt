Title: Cubes

Exercise: A number raised to the third power is called a cube For example,
the cube of 2 is written as 2**3 in Python. Make a list of the first 10 cubes (that
is, the cube of each integer from 1 through 10), and use a for loop to print out
the value of each cube.

Answer:

my_list = []
for number in range(1, 11):
    cube = number**3
    my_list.append(cube)

for cube in my_list:
    print(cube)
