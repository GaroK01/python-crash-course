Title: Changing Guest List

Question: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the
dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of
someone else to invite.
• Start with your program from Exercise 3-4 Add a print statement at the
end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.
• Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with
the name of the new person you are inviting.
• Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still
in your list.

Answer: 

guests = ['Garry Kasparov', 'Magnus Carlsen', 'Bobby Fischer']


print(f'Hey {guests[0]}, you are invited to my dinner party.')
print(f'Hey {guests[1]}, you are invited to my dinner party.')
print(f'Hey {guests[2]}, you are invited to my dinner party.')

print(f'Unfortunately, {guests[2]} will be absent.')

del(guests[2])
guests.insert(2, 'Anatoly Karpov')


print(f'Hey {guests[0]}, you are invited to my dinner party.')
print(f'Hey {guests[1]}, you are invited to my dinner party.')
print(f'Hey {guests[2]}, you are invited to my dinner party.')
