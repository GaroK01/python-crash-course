Title: Intentional Error

Exercise: If you havenâ€™t received an index error in one of your
programs yet, try to make one happen. Change an index in one of your pro-
grams to produce an index error. Make sure you correct the error before clos-
ing the program.

Answer:

random_list = ['Anything', 'Something']

# print(random_list[2]) This will give you an error

print(random_list[-1]) # This will not
