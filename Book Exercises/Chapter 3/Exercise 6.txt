Title: More Guests

Question: You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is
available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.
• Start with your program from Exercise 3-4 or Exercise 3-5. Add a print
statement to the end of your program informing people that you found a
bigger dinner table.
• Use insert() to add one new guest to the beginning of your list.
• Use insert() to add one new guest to the middle of your list.
• Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list.
• Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.

Answer: 

guests = ['Garry Kasparov', 'Magnus Carlsen', 'Bobby Fischer']

print(f'Hey {guests[0]}, you are invited to my dinner party.')
print(f'Hey {guests[1]}, you are invited to my dinner party.')
print(f'Hey {guests[2]}, you are invited to my dinner party.')

print(f'Unfortunately, {guests[2]} will be absent.')

del(guests[2])
guests.insert(2, 'Anatoly Karpov')

print(f'Hey {guests[0]}, you are invited to my dinner party.')
print(f'Hey {guests[1]}, you are invited to my dinner party.')
print(f'Hey {guests[2]}, you are invited to my dinner party.')
print('Good news! I have found a bigger table!')
guests.insert(0,'Vladimir Kramnik')
guests.insert(2,'Mikhail Tal')
guests.insert(2,'Bobby Fischer')
guests.append('Boris Spasky')
print(f'Welcome to my party {guests[0]}, have fun!')
print(f'Welcome to my party {guests[1]}, have fun!')
print(f'Welcome to my party {guests[2]}, have fun!')
print(f'Welcome to my party {guests[3]}, have fun!')
print(f'Welcome to my party {guests[4]}, have fun!')
