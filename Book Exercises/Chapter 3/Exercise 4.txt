Title: Guest List

Question: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who
would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to
invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting
them to dinner.

Answer:

guests = ['Garry Kasparov', 'Magnus Carlsen', 'Bobby Fischer']

print(f'Hey {guests[0]}, you are invited to my dinner party.')
print(f'Hey {guests[1]}, you are invited to my dinner party.')
print(f'Hey {guests[2]}, you are invited to my dinner party.')
