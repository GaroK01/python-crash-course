Title: Greetings

Question: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just
printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message
should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the
person’s name.

Answer:

friends = ['John', 'Matthew', 'Mark', 'Luke']

print (f'Hello dear {friends[0]}!')
print (f'Hello dear {friends[1]}!')
print (f'Hello dear {friends[2]}!')
print (f'Hello dear {friends[3]}!')
