Title: Dinner Guests

Exercise: Working with one of the programs from Exercises 3-4
through 3-7 (page 46), use len() to print a message indicating the number
of people you are inviting to dinner.

Answer: 

guests = ['Garry Kasparov', 'Magnus Carlsen', 'Bobby Fischer']

print(f'Hey {guests[0]}, you are invited to my dinner party.')
print(f'Hey {guests[1]}, you are invited to my dinner party.')
print(f'Hey {guests[2]}, you are invited to my dinner party.')

number_of_guests = len(guests)
print(f'I have invited {number_of_guests} guests.')
