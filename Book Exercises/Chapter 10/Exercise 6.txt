Title: Addition

Exercise: One common problem when prompting for numerical input
occurs when people provide text instead of numbers When you try to convert
the input to an int, you’ll get a TypeError. Write a program that prompts for
two numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch the TypeError if
either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message Test your
program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a
number.

Answer:

try:
  n = input("Give me a number: ")
  n = int(n)

  n1 = input("Give me another number: ")
  n1 = int(n1)
except ValueError:
  print("Please enter a valid number.")
else:
  sum = n + n1
  print(f"The sum of {n} and {n1} is {sum}.")
