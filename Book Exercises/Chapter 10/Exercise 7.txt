Title: Addition Calculator

Exercise: Wrap your code from Exercise 10-5 in a while loop
so the user can continue entering numbers, even if they make a mistake and
enter text instead of a number.

Answer:

print("Enter 'q' to quit.")

while True:
  try:
    n = input("Give me a number: ")
    if n == 'q':
      break

    n = int(n)
  
    n1 = input("Give me another number: ")
    if n1 == 'q':
      break
  
    n1 = int(n1)

  except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number.")

  else:
    sum = n + n1
    print(f"The sum of {n} and {n1} is {sum}.")
