Title: Guest Book

Exercise: Write a while loop that prompts users for their name. When
they enter their name, print a greeting to the screen and add a line recording
their visit in a file called guest_book.txt. Make sure each entry appears on a
new line in the file.

Answer:

path = 'guest_book.txt'

while True:
  name = input("Enter your name:")
  if name == 'quit':
    break
  else:
    print(f"Thank you for visiting {name}!")
    with open(path, 'a') as file_object:
      file_object.append(name)
