Title: Favorite Number Remembered

Exercise: Combine the two programs you wrote in
Exercise 10-11 into one file. If the number is already stored, report the favorite
number to the user. If not, prompt for the user’s favorite number and store it in a
file. Run the program twice to see that it works.

Answer:

import json

filename = 'favorite_number.json'
try:
  with open(filename, 'r') as file:
    contents = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
  number = input("What's your favorite number? ")
  contents = json.dumps(number)
  with open(filename, 'w') as file:
    file.write(contents)
  print("Thank you!")
else:
  number = json.loads(contents)
  print(f"I know your favorite number! It's {number}.")
