Title: Programming Poll

Exercise: Write a while loop that asks people why they like
programming. Each time someone enters a reason, add their reason to a file
that stores all the responses.

Answer:

path = 'programming_reasons.txt'
print("Enter 'quit' when you are finished.\n")

while True:
  reason = input("Why do you like programming? ")
  if reason.lower() == 'quit':
    break
  else:
    with open(filename, 'a') as file_object:
      file_object.write(reason + '\n')
