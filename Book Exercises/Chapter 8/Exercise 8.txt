Title: User Albums

Exercise: Start with your program from Exercise 8-7. Write a while
loop that allows users to enter an album’s artist and title. Once you have that
information, call make_album() with the user’s input and print the dictionary
that’s created. Be sure to include a quit value in the while loop.

Answer:

def make_album(artist, title, tracks=0):
  album_dict = {'artist': artist.title(),
                'title': title.title(),}
  if tracks:
    album_dict['tracks'] = tracks
  return album_dict

while True:
  title = input('What album do you like?')
  if title == 'quit':
    break

  artist = input('Who is the artist?')
  if artist == 'quit':
    break

  album = make_album(artist, title)
  print(album)
