Title: Cities

Exercise: Write a function called describe_city() that accepts the name of
a city and its country. The function should print a simple sentence, such as
Reykjavik is in Iceland. Give the parameter for the country a default value.
Call your function for three different cities, at least one of which is not in the
default country.
