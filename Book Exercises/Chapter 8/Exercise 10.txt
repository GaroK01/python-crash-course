Title: Great Magicians

Exercise: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 8-9.
Write a function called make_great() that modifies the list of magicians by adding
the phrase the Great to each magician’s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the
list has actually been modified.

Answer:

magicians = ["Harry Houdini", "David Copperfield", "Dynamo"]

def show_magicians(magician_list):
  for magician in magician_list:
    print(magician)

def make_great(magician_list):
  for i in range(len(magician_list)):
    magician_list[i] = "the Great " + magician_list[i]

make_great(magicians)
show_magicians(magicians)
