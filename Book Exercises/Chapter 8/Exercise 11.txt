Title: Unchanged Magicians

Exercise: Start with your work from Exercise 8-10 Call the
function make_great() with a copy of the list of magicians’ names. Because the
original list will be unchanged, return the new list and store it in a separate list.
Call show_magicians() with each list to show that you have one list of the original
names and one list with the Great added to each magician’s name.

Answer:

magicians = ["Harry Houdini", "David Copperfield", "Dynamo"]

def show_magicians(magician_list):
  for magician in magician_list:
    print(magician)

def make_great(magician_list):
  great_magicians = []
  for magician in magician_list:
    great_magicians.append("the Great " + magician)
  return great_magicians

great_magicians = make_great(magicians[:])

print("Original magicians:")
show_magicians(magicians)

print("Great magicians:")
show_magicians(great_magicians)
