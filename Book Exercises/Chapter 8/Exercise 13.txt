Title: User Profile

Exercise: Start with a copy of user_profile.py from page 153 Build
a profile of yourself by calling build_profile(), using your first and last names
and three other key-value pairs that describe you.

Answer:

def build_profile(first, last, **user_info):
  profile = {}
  profile['first_name'] = first
  profile['last_name'] = last
  for key, value in user_info.items():
    profile[key] = value
  return profile

user_profile = build_profile('Garo', 'Kalfayan', hobby='football', field='computer science', favourite_team ='Manchester United')
print(user_profile)
