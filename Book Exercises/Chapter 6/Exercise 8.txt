Title: Pets

Exercise: Make several dictionaries, where the name of each dictionary is the
name of a pet. In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the ownerâ€™s
name. Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Next, loop through your list
and as you do print everything you know about each pet.

Answer:

pets = []

dog = {'type': 'dog', 'name': 'Lucky', 'owner': 'Steven'}
pets.append(dog)

cat = {'type': 'cat', 'name': 'Sugar', 'owner': 'Martin'}
pets.append(cat)

for pet in pets:
  print(f"{pet['owner']} has a {pet['type']} named {pet['name']}")
