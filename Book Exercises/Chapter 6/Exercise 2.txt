Title: Favorite Numbers

Exercise: Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite numbers.
Think of five names, and use them as keys in your dictionary. Think of a favorite
number for each person, and store each as a value in your dictionary. Print
each person’s name and their favorite number. For even more fun, poll a few
friends and get some actual data for your program.

Answer:

fav_numbers = {'Paul': 10, 'Christ': 3, 'Kevin': 100, 'Luke': 99, 'Sean': 7}

print(f"Paul's favourite number is {fav_numbers['Paul']}")
print(f"Christ's favourite number is {fav_numbers['Christ']}")
print(f"Kevin's favourite number is {fav_numbers['Kevin']}")
print(f"Luke's favourite number is {fav_numbers['Luke']}")
print(f"Sean's favourite number is {fav_numbers['Sean']}")
