Title: Glossary 2

Exercise: Now that you know how to loop through a dictionary, clean
up the code from Exercise 6-3 (page 102) by replacing your series of print
statements with a loop that runs through the dictionary’s keys and values.
When you’re sure that your loop works, add five more Python terms to your
glossary. When you run your program again, these new words and meanings
should automatically be included in the output.

Answer:
glossary = {
    'variable': 'A name that stores a value, which can change during program execution.',
    'function': 'A block of reusable code that performs a specific task.',
    'loop': 'A structure that repeats a block of code while a condition is true.',
    'list': 'An ordered collection of items that can be changed (mutable).',
    'dictionary': 'A collection of key-value pairs that stores data in mappings.',
    'tuple': 'An ordered collection of items that cannot be changed (immutable).',
    'string': 'A sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.',
    'boolean': 'A data type that can hold one of two values: True or False.',
    'set': 'An unordered collection of unique items.',
    'if': 'A control structure used to make decisions in code.'
}
