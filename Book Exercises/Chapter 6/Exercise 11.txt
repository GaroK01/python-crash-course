Title: Cities

Exercise: Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names of three cities as
keys in your dictionary. Create a dictionary of information about each city and
include the country that the city is in, its approximate population, and one fact
about that city. The keys for each city’s dictionary should be something like
country, population, and fact. Print the name of each city and all of the infor-
mation you have stored about it.

Answer: 

cities = {
    'Tokyo': {'country': 'Japan',
              'population': '37 million',
              'fact': 'Tokyo is the most populous metropolitan area in the world.'},
    'Paris': {'country': 'France',
              'population': '11 million',
              'fact': 'Paris is known as the “City of Light.”'},
    'New York': {'country': 'USA',

                'fact': 'New York City is home to Times Square and Central Park.'}
         } 

for city, info in cities.items():
    print(f"City: {city}")
    print(f"Country: {info['country']}")
    print(f"Population: {info['population']}")
    print(f"Fact: {info['fact']}")
