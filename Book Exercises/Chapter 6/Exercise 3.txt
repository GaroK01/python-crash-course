Title: Glossary

Exercise: A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary.
However, to avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary.
• Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous
chapters. Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store their
meanings as values.
• Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might
print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print the word
on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. Use the
newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between each word-meaning
pair in your output.

Answer:

glossary = {
    'variable': 'A name that stores a value, which can change during program execution.',
    'function': 'A block of reusable code that performs a specific task.',
    'loop': 'A structure that repeats a block of code while a condition is true.',
    'list': 'An ordered collection of items that can be changed (mutable).',
    'dictionary': 'A collection of key-value pairs that stores data in mappings.'
}

print(f"Variable:\n{glossary['variable']}")
print(f"Function:\n{glossary['function']}")
print(f"Loop:\n{glossary['loop']}")
print(f"List:\n{glossary['list']}")
print(f"Dictionary:\n{glossary['dictionary']}")
