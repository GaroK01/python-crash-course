Title: Pizza Toppings

Exercise: Write a loop that prompts the user to enter a series of
pizza toppings until they enter a 'quit' value. As they enter each topping,
print a message saying youâ€™ll add that topping to their pizza.

Answer:

flag = True
print ("What toppings do you want on your pizza?")

while flag:
  topping = input("Enter your topping. If done enter quit ")
  if topping == 'quit':
    break
  else:
    print(f"I will add {topping} on your pizza")
