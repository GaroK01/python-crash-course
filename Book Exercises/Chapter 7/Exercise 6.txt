Title: Three Exits

Exercise: Write different versions of either Exercise 7-4 or Exercise 7-5
that do each of the following at least once:
• Use a conditional test in the while statement to stop the loop.
• Use an active variable to control how long the loop runs.
• Use a break statement to exit the loop when the user enters a 'quit' value.

Answer:

flag = True
print ("What toppings do you want on your pizza?")

while flag:
  topping = input("Enter your topping. If done enter quit ")
  if topping == 'quit':
    flag = false # I changed this line to achieve the second condition (the other two are already completed in Exercise 4)
  else:
    print(f"I will add {topping} on your pizza")
