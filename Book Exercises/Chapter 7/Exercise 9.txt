Title: No Pastrami

Exercise: Using the list sandwich_orders from Exercise 7-8, make sure
the sandwich 'pastrami' appears in the list at least three times. Add code
near the beginning of your program to print a message saying the deli has
run out of pastrami, and then use a while loop to remove all occurrences of
'pastrami' from sandwich_orders. Make sure no pastrami sandwiches end up
in finished_sandwiches.

Answer:

sandwich_orders = ["pastrami", "Turkey & Swiss", "Ham & Cheese", "pastrami", "BLT", "Club Sandwich", "Grilled Cheese", "pastrami"]
finished_sandwiches = []

print("We're out of pastrami today.")
while 'pastrami' in sandwich_orders:
  sandwich_orders.remove('pastrami')

while sandwich_orders:
  sandwich = sandwich_orders.pop()
  print(f"I made your {sandwich} sandwich.")
  finished_sandwiches.append(sandwich)

for sandwich in finished_sandwiches:
  print(f"{sandwich} sandwich was prepared.")
