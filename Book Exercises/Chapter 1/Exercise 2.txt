Title: Hello World Typos

Question: Open the hello_world.py file you just created. Make a
typo somewhere in the line and run the program again. Can you make a typo
that generates an error? Can you make sense of the error message? Can you
make a typo that doesn’t generate an error? Why do you think it didn’t make
an error?

Answer: The file needed is present in the res folder of the same chapter.
Basically add random texts to the file, save it, then run the program again.
(You could misspell the "print" command, "prnt")
You will see the error in the command line, and it will explain it to you where is the
error and why it got raised.
(You could write an erroneous message in the print function print("HEYOO"))
Well, because we didn't add write anything that is not understood by the compiler.
The typo is inside a string (text), which Python doesn’t interpret — it just prints it as-is.
